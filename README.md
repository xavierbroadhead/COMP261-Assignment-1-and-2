# COMP261 Assignment 1 & 2
First and second assignment for my COMP261 class - topics covered include effective data management/string searching using Tries and an A* implementation. We were given data sets of Auckland's road system and were tasked with displaying that data in a coherent way on an interface that allowed for road searching, along with A* pathfinding.
